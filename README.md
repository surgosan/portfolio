# Portfolio

Hey, i'm Sergio and this is the source code to my portfolio.

This single-page application is build with **Vue.js**.

I am always looking for ways to update and enchance it.

## Current Future Plans
- Move page links to top and create a navbar

- Implement a backend database so that users can add and pull information.
  - Users can add their name to visited?
  - Users can add suggestions?
    - I can give them an property of completed which I will modify when I implement it.
  - Location for all implementations?

- Clean up About page
