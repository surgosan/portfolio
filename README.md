- Bring about content closer? Change layout to boxed areas?
- Update downloadable (resume, etc.)
- Playground area to play with data in a database using logic
- Redesign projects page to be more interactive
  - Remove slide
  - Create multiple imgs & videos
  - Have icons to highlight skill involved.
    - Skills involved may be color coded
