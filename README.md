# Portfolio

Hey, i'm Sergio and this is the source code to my portfolio.

This single-page application is build with **Vue.js**.

I am always looking for ways to update and enhance it.

## Current Future Plans
- Optimise for smaller screens
- Change project to be landscape
- Update about page
- Fix issue where site breaks if refreshed a page that is not home page
- Bring about content closer? Change layout to boxed areas?
