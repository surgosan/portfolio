# Original Portfolio Mobile App

## Overview

I re-created my portfolio as an IOS application. I wanted to 
gain experience in not only web development, but also mobile apps.
This way, if I were to create a web application in the future, I 
would have the necessary skills to create an IOS application of it.

## Tools

I used XCode on a MacBook Air to write the code as well
as run the simulation.

## Takeaway

I learned a great deal of front-end development for mobile
applications. I did not make any Api calls in this project.
Similar to my *Bunk-a-Biker Project*, I focused on improving
my basic skills involving design.

I do not expect someone to download the application
and run it themselves, so I will just provide
as short demonstration.
