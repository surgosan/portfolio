# Chess Master SWE Team Project

## Overview

This is a project that I worked with a small team in my
Intro to Software Engineering class. We split up into 
front-end and back-end groups to tackle creating an 
application that allows a host to set up a tournament
with brackets. This project was created in Java
and JavaFX.

I worked mainly on the backend for this project.
I focused on storing and retrieving information as
well as creating the method for which the application
will create the match ups. I also helped with the 
front-end development wherever they needed.

## Use

The host is able to insert teams and the application
will automatically pair them up with each other for the
season. It will provide days and times for which the 
teams will face off each other. 

The host is also able to remove or edit teams and 
match ups whenever they feel. 

The guest user is able to view these matches, but not
edit them.

## Takeaway

This project helped me learn to work with data and 
experience working with others. I took charge over the 
team and worked to ensure that our work progressed
smoothly.
