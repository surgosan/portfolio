# Bunk-a-Biker Website Redesign

![Social Page][2]

## Overview

Bunk-a-Biker is a service similar to AirBnB for 
motorcyclists. I took a look at their site in 2021
and decided that I would attempt to redesign it.

I noticed that the site was rather out of date,
so I tried to recreate it in a more modern and 
attractive fashion.

## Apis

While I worked on improving my HTML and CSS skills, I
also took the chance to learn about APIs. I took a
look at the Google Maps API so that I could 
integrate a map right into the website.

## Static Development

I kept this site as a static site since at the time,
I was still working on improving my base HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript skills.

## Takeaway

This project helped me learn a lot about the basics
of web development. It is no understatement to say
that this is the start of my web development
journey. I experimented with a lot of objects and 
properties that HTML and CSS have to offer as well
as how I could manipulate them with JavaScript.
