# Application Hub

## Overview

I used this project to improve on my desktop application
development skills. I kept to Java and JavaFX from Gluon
to create this desktop application. I use it for small
trivial actions that I am too lazy to do myself.

I set up the calculation in Java. The application accepts
in multiple parameters and outputs an appropriate answer.


## Takeaway

I help solidify my Java and JavaFX skills with this
project and helped me gain confidence with desktop
applications. It also helped me better understand the
(*MVC*) Model View Controller.
